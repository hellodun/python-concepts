# Understanding if-statements

## Getting started

There's no need for parenthesis or cury braces when working with if-else
- No parenthesis for single condition

```py
k = 1
if k > 2:
    k -1
elif k == 2:
    k * 2
else:
    k += 2
```

For multiple conditionals, parenthesisare needed

*NOTE"* - `&&` is used as `and` while `||` is used as `or`.
```py
a, b = 2, 4

if ((a > 2 and a!= b) or a == b):
    n +=1 
```
